Using Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy (but not Vue, yet) to query a random record from a MySQL table with nearly 30K German sentences taken from the [Universit√§t Leipzig Corpora](https://corpora.uni-leipzig.de/en?corpusId=deu_newscrawl-public_2018).

Removed the Vue-CLI boilerplate from this branch.

I'd like to explore building out the site

1. without Vue (or any significant amount of JS);

2. using Vue components to improve the UI;

3. merging back to `master`;

4. deploying the whole thing to Heroku.

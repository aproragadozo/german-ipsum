Using axios in the VueCLI3 app to query the route exposed by Flask.

Having trouble serving the data from the Flask-SQLAlchemy server because CORS (I'll try hosting this not on localhost).

Also having trouble cnverting the database query that returns a single MySQL table row to JSON.

flask-marshmallow looks like an option to look into.
